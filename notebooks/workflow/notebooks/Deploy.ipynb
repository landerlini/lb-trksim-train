    "In this notebook we discussed the procedure to export the trained models to a shared C library that can be easily \n",
    "imported at run time in Gaudi-based applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure used involves three steps:\n",
    " * collapsing the model from a functional form to a sequential model;\n",
    " * generating C code for the steps and completing it with the logic describing the sequence of the steps;\n",
    " * compiling the C code into a shared library.\n",
    " \n",
    "Finally, we have validated the procedure by comparing the results obtained running the original, collapsed and exported models on a subset of the training dataset.\n",
    "Studying the distributions we observe that the conversion introduces a small level of discrepancy between the exported and original data, probably because of floating point algebra or small discrepancies in the implementations of the quantile transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, the distributions are very well reproduced and the pathological entries are at the permil level or less, with relative errors of few percents that should not compromise the overall quality of the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most worrying case is probably the resolution where in $\\mathcal O(10^{-5})$ cases the events are pushed very far from the original value and might end up in unphysical regions. This might require to crop the resolution distribution to avoid outlayers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuning the hyperparameters of the quantile transformers is known to have a significan effect on these discrepancies. However, increasing the number of bins also slows down the evaluation, so that a trade-off between speed and \"safety\" must be found."
